f.xsl  f.xml links to f.xsl as it's transformation to html

1 file is generated by xsl transformation:
f.htm this file is not persisted. It will only be seen after successfull xsl transformation when source code is viewed

f.htm contains besides html a huge portion of javascript that dynamically displays a small portion of mapped notes
