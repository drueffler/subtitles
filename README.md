Display Text along a timeline

2 files are are used:
   (1) a.xml -  contains 3 components: (1) xml view of a midi file (2) mapping instructions note-to-text (3) duration info
   (2) a.xsl -  a.xml links to a.xsl as it's transformation to html

1 file is generated by xsl transformation:
   (1) a.htm - this file is not persisted. It will only be seen after successfull xsl transformation when source code is viewed

a.htm contains besides html a huge portion of javascript that dynamically displays a small portion of mapped notes

Further steps:
When a.htm is displayed and button pressed then subtitles are played.
Generate a screen recording and save to mp4
f.mp4 can be used for livestreaming by periscope.tv

The set of files named "a" represent the initial approach for displaying text alon a timeline - by html
Future or following sets of files will represent different approaches and show other names like "b", "c", ...
The html approach will be followed by a svg apporach: "b"

a - html approach
b - svg approach failed: After rewriting text node animation is lost - don't know why
c - svg approach better: No rewriting of nodes - continuously adding new nodes - success with animation 
d - svg approach big picture: creating big grouped picture with only one animatinon: Translate the group
